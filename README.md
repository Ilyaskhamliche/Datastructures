# M01.1:
For this program I define a class RomanType that stores a Roman numeral and its corresponding decimal value. It provides functions to convert a Roman numeral to decimal form, as well as to print the Roman numeral and its decimal value.

# M01.2:
In this program I begin to initializes an integer array with 5 elements and assigns the memory address of the first element to a pointer. It then uses pointer arithmetic to access each element of the array and print its value.
